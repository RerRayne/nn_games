 Hello, here I'm going to publish some neural networks notebooks using TensorFlow and PyTorch.
 
 Right now two notebooks are published: [MLP_TF.ipynb](https://github.com/RerRayne/nn_games/blob/master/MLP_TF.ipynb), [MLP_PyTorch.ipynb](https://github.com/RerRayne/nn_games/blob/master/MLP_PyTorch.ipynb). These notebooks demonstrate how to work with TensorBoard with TensorFlow and PyTorch.
 
 For more details refer [TensorBoard repo](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard) and [TensorBoardX repo](https://github.com/lanpa/tensorboardX).
